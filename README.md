## Notes

| Day | Done | Link | Notes |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1) | Pretty simple? why? am i doing wrong?
| 2   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2) | Part B logic had to be drawn out and had to fix a few minor bugs but wasn't that tough overall
| 3   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3) | Incredibly fun to figure out, ngl
| 4   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/4) | Part B doesnt look very optimized? But was pretty easy
| 5   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/5) | Part B got me stuck for looooooong. Had to ask llm for better cases and then settled on sort and merge approach
| 6   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6) | Made me really think but was pretty fun to figure out. Seemed easier than Day 5
