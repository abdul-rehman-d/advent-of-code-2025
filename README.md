# Advent Of Code 2025

Trying to see how many stars can i get on [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/)

## Notes

| Day | Done | Link | Notes |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1) | Pretty simple? why? am i doing wrong?
| 2   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2) | Part B logic had to be drawn out and had to fix a few minor bugs but wasn't that tough overall
| 3   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3) | Incredibly fun to figure out, ngl
| 4   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/4) | Part B doesnt look very optimized? But was pretty easy
| 5   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/5) | Part B got me stuck for looooooong. Had to ask llm for better cases and then settled on sort and merge approach
| 6   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6) | Made me really think but was pretty fun to figure out. Seemed easier than Day 5
| 7   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/7) | SUPER FUN! I think I finally understand Dynamic Programming to solve the part B first try? Love how ambigious the question phrasing was and hence how rewarding it was to solve it. Took my time, ngl but with a bit whiteboarding, got it perfectly
| 8   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/8) | Was **extremely** tricky.. Took way too long on part A but mainly my fault to play too much with pointers but learned my lesson. Another day without a video or LLM to help. Took nearly 2.5 hours to crack part A but then part B was easy. _(Note to self: run with `MAX=1000 go run main.go solve 8`)_
| 9   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/9) | Was **extremely** difficult.. Part A was very fun.. Part B i had to find the algorithm. Turns out we have to use something called raycasting. and it also depends on the input being in sequence. despite this [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w5mFTtRLE8), my solution couldnt crack it.. because even checking corners in polygon isnt enough apparently. it is too freaky. Will look at Day 10 before i try this again..
